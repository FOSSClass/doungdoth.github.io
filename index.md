## USB Booting Issues?

## If you're like me, you may have had an issue come up when my PC did not want to boot the USB even after going to Bios and selecting appropriate device. Error message popped up saying something along the lines of "device is broken"? So what do you do?

## After you install what ever that it is you want on your external device ( in this case USB specifically), you may find out that you are finding some trouble getting it to work. Now there are some ways to go about this. 

## How to boot the USB once installed. 

## Usually something needs to be configured in the BIOS of your computer. That means tweaking a few settings to allow the USB to recognized and run. Once you do this, your USB device should now be able to run and work.

## What is BIOS?
